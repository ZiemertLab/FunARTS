# Fungal bioActive compound Resistant Target Seeker (FunARTS) Overview

FunARTS is a specific and efficient mining tool for the identification of fungal bioactive compounds with interesting and novel targets.
The aims of FunARTS are to (i) automate the process of target-directed (also called resistance-guided) genome mining in fungi, 
(ii) screen for potential novel bioactive compound targets, and (iii) prioritize putative Biosynthetic Gene Clusters (BGCs) for their subsequent characterization.

FunARTS can be installed locally, or you can use the free public webserver located at https://funarts.ziemertlab.com

See https://github.com/ziemertlab/funarts for a guide on installing the main analysis pipeline independently.

See https://github.com/ziemertlab/funartswebapp for a guide on installing the webserver independently.


## Quick start with docker:

- Firstly, if you don't have Docker, you should install the Docker engine on your computer. Please check out the latest version of Docker 
[on the official website.](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)

- To run FunARTS Image, you should download the "docker_run_funarts.py" file from the command line or from the repository using a web browser.
```bash
    mkdir FunARTSdocker && cd FunARTSdocker
    wget https://github.com/ziemertlab/funarts/raw/master/docker_run_funarts.py
```
**Note:** Python 3.x is needed to run "docker_run_funarts.py".

- FunARTS Image include only Ascomycota reference set. If you need other reference sets, please download (~450MB) and unzip all of them.
```bash
    mkdir FunARTSdocker && cd FunARTSdocker
    wget https://funarts.ziemertlab.com/static/zip_refsets/reference.zip
    unzip reference.zip 
```
- Enter the required arguments and run the script
```bash
    python docker_run_funarts.py [-h] [input] [resultdir] [-optional_arguments]
```

  -t THRESH, --thresh THRESH
                        Hmm reporting threshold. Use global bitscore value or Model specific options: gathering= GA,
                        trusted= TC, noise= NC(default: none)

````
## Usage 

- For basic run with positional arguments;
````
    python docker_run_funarts.py /PATH/input_genome.gbk /PATH/result_folder
````

- To use antiSMASH, please use: `-ras`, `--runantismash`;
````
    python docker_run_funarts.py /PATH/input_genome.gbk /PATH/result_folder -ras
````
- To use other reference sets (default: ascomycota);
````
    python docker_run_funarts.py /PATH/input_genome.gbk /PATH/result_folder -refdir /PATH/reference_set_file
````
- For multi-genome input, it is enough to put commas without any space between the paths of genome files;
````
    python docker_run_funarts.py /PATH/input_genome1.gbk,/PATH/input_genome2.gbk,/PATH/input_genome3.gbk /PATH/result_folder
````

- It is possible to run FunARTS if there is a .json files of antiSMASH 6.1.1 results;
````
    python docker_run_funarts.py /PATH/antismash_result.json /PATH/result_folder
````

- To run FunARTS analysis options, please use `-opt`, `--options` parameter (default: None);
````
    python docker_run_funarts.py /PATH/input_genome.gbk /PATH/result_folder -ras -opt kres,duf,expert 
````

- To run the BiG-SCAPE algorithms, please use `-rbsc`, `--runbigscape`;
````
    python docker_run_funarts.py /PATH/input_genome1.gbk,/PATH/input_genome2.gbk /PATH/result_folder -ras -rbsc
